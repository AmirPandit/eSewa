# ESewa Full-Stack Application

This is a full-stack application with a **Django** backend and a **React** frontend. It uses **Docker** and **Docker Compose** to easily set up and run the entire application in isolated containers.

## Requirements

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Docker**: You can download and install Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- **Docker Compose**: Docker Compose is usually included with Docker Desktop, but you can install it separately from [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/esewa.git
cd esewa
````

### 2. Install Docker

If you don't have Docker installed, download and install Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started). Follow the instructions for your operating system.

---

## Running the Application

Once you've cloned the repository and installed Docker, follow these steps to get the application running:

### 1. Build and Start the Containers

Run the following command to build and start the Docker containers for both the backend and frontend:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will:

- Build the backend and frontend images.
- Set up and start the PostgreSQL database container.
- Automatically link the backend and frontend containers.

### 2. Access the Application

- **Backend (Django)**: You can access the backend API at `http://localhost:8000`.
- **Frontend (React)**: You can access the frontend application at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Stopping the Application

To stop the containers and remove them, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This command stops all running containers and removes them, but the data in the PostgreSQL volume will be preserved.

If you want to completely remove everything, including the volumes (which will remove the database data), you can run:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Issue: Backend takes a long time to start or doesn’t start**  
  _Solution:_ Ensure that the database is up and running. The backend waits for the PostgreSQL container to be ready before starting. Check the logs of the database container with `docker logs db`.

- **Issue: Port conflicts**  
  If the ports `8000` or `3000` are already in use on your machine, you can modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to use different ports.

---

## Notes

- **Database Setup**: The database is automatically set up with the following credentials:

  - **Database**: `esewaChat`
  - **User**: `amir`
  - **Password**: `esewa@0D8H`

  The backend service waits for the database to be ready before it starts.

- **Frontend and Backend Communication**: The frontend communicates with the backend API via `http://backend:8000` inside the Docker network. No need to modify the frontend code for the API URL.

- **Hot Reloading**: Both the frontend and backend are configured with live reloading. Changes made to the code on your local machine will automatically reflect in the containers (via mounted volumes).

### Key Features of the README:
- **Project Structure**: This gives a clear view of the folder structure, so users understand where to find different files.
- **Step-by-Step Setup**: A clear sequence of commands for setting up the project, making it easy for anyone to get started.
- **Troubleshooting Section**: Helps users debug any potential issues they may encounter while running the application.
- **Notes**: Provides useful information like the database credentials and the fact that the frontend communicates with the backend using internal Docker networking.

Now, after pulling the repository and running `docker-compose up --build`, the users will have everything set up to work without needing any additional configurations.
